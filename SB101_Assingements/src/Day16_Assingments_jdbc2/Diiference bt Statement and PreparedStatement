Q1/- What is the Difference between the Statement and the PreparedStatement?


Both Statement and PreparedStatement can be used to execute SQL queries
These interfaces look very similar.

Statement
        1- it is used to execute string-based SQL queries;
        2-when we use Statement(I) object to perform any DataBase operation
           then Statement object has the following limitations;
           i-Complexities to concatenate dynamic variables;
           ii- whenever we perform some DataBase problem using
              Statement object the database engine will perform 
              following task every time to execute that query
              i-query compilation;
              ii-query plan-generation;
              iii-query optimization;
                         
  
  
PreparedStatement-
                 i-using Ps we perform parameterized SQL Q=queries;
                 ii-using ps we degrade the performance;
