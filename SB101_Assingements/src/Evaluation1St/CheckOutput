Question 4: What will be the output of below code and why?

public class CheckOutput {
  public static void main(String args[]){
		try
		{
		   System.out.print("A");
		   int num = 99/0;
		   System.out.print("B");
		}catch(ArithmeticException ex){
		   System.out.print("C");
		}catch(Exception ex){
		  System.out.print("D");
		}
		System.out.print("E");
   }
}



******************************

  here the output of the above code is ACE;
  
  because whenn the jvm start to compile the code first line no7 done after that it gon to line no8 here it get exception then
  the jvm compiler check weather the exception handeld or not but it is handeled so it go to check block and get priority to Arithamatic Exception 
  and get the message in arithamtic check bolock after it go to last line of the code and execute the line and get normal trmination of the code ;
