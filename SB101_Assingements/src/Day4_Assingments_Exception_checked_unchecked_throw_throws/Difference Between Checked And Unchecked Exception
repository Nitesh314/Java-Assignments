                     Exception always  occur at a runTime
                     Those Exception is forced to handled At a compile time is called checked Exception
                     
                     here Those exception is direct child of Exception class including Exception is  a checked Exception

2) Unchecked Exception=>
                        We know that exception  always occur at runtime  
                        here those Exception is not forced to handled the Exception at runtime is called unchecked Exception;
                        
                        here those exception is direct child of RunTimeException is called checked exception 
                        
                        1)ArithmeticException;
                        2)ClassCastException;
                        3)NullPointerException;
                        4)ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException;
                        5)IllegalThreadStateException;
