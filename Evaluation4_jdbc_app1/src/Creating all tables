Student:
	roll: int primary key
	name: varchar(12) not null,
	address: varchar(12) not null,
	mobile: varchar(10) not null

Course:
	cid: int primary key,
	cname: varchar(12) not null,
	fee: int not null,
    duration: varchar(12) not null


● Establish Many-to-Many relationships between the Student and the Course
table


   Create table Student(
    roll int primary key,
	name varchar(12) not null,
	address varchar(12) not null,
	mobile varchar(10) not null
	);
	
	
Create table Course(
	cid int primary key,
	cname varchar(12) not null,
	fee int not null,
    duration varchar(12) not null
    );
    
    
 //establish many to many relationship we create one table called Studetn_Course;
 
 
   Create table Student_Course(
        cs_roll int ,
        cs_cid int,
        Foreign key(cs_roll) references Student(roll),
        Foreign key(cs_cid) references Course(cid)
        );
         
	
Q2/- Consider the following tables:

● Establish a One-to-Many relationship between the Department and Employee table


Department:
	did: int primary key,
	dname: varchar(12) not null,
	location: varchar(12) not null
	
Employee:
	empId: int primary key,
	ename: varchar(12) not null,
	address: varchar(12) not null,
	mobile: varchar(12) not null,
	salary: int not null,
	deptId: int
	
	
	
  Create table Department(
 	did int primary key,
	dname varchar(12) not null,
	location varchar(12) not null
	);
	
	
	
Create Table Employee(	
    empId int primary key,
	ename varchar(12) not null,
	address varchar(12) not null,
	mobile varchar(12) not null,
	salary int not null,
	deptId int,
	Foreign key(deptId) references Department(did)
	);




● Write a SQL query to get the total salary of employees, department-wise.

   Select d.dname,SUM(e.salary) from employee e INNER JOIN department d ON d.did=e.deptid group by d.dname;

			| dname     | SUM(e.salary) |
			+-----------+---------------+
			| Account   |         95000 |
			| Sales     |        161000 |
			| Marketing |         80000 |
			| HR        |        165000 |
			+-----------+---------------+
   
   //without joins
   
   select d.dname, SUM(e.salary) from employee e, department d where d.did=e.deptid group by d.dname;
+-----------+---------------+
| dname     | SUM(e.salary) |
+-----------+---------------+
| Account   |         95000 |

| Marketing |         80000 |
| HR        |        165000 |
+-----------+---------------+





● Write a SQL query to get all the employee details who enrolled in the Sales
  department.


select * from employee e INNER JOIN department d ON e.deptid=d.did AND d.dname='sales';

● Write a SQL query to get the Department details for an employee based on the
  empId.

select e.empid,e.ename,e.salary,d.did,d.dname,d.location from employee e,department d where e.deptid=d.did AND e.empid='3';

● Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary paid employee from the
Employee table
	
	
	   Select salary AS 2Max_Salary,ename AS Employee_Name
	   FROM
	   employee
	   WHERE
